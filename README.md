# Ultimate Sticker Studio

Welcome to **the** Ultimate Sticker Studio :). This is my first swift project, this app may be simple but the main point of it was for me to learn how to use Swift and SwiftUI.

## Setup

### Environment Variables
The only thing you need for the env variable is the Stabilty API Key that you can get [here](https://platform.stability.ai/).

Look at .env.example to see how to format it

## Next Steps
Some features I am planning to add are 
- Sticker effects (like fire in the background)
- Nicer UI/UX
- Encryption for data sent to AI
- iCloud integration
- Any other suggestions are welcome!
